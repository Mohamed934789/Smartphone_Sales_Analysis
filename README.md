- `Brand`: Manufacturer name  
- `RAM_GB`, `Storage_GB`, `Screen_Size`, `Battery_mAh`: Technical specs  
- `Price_USD`: Selling price in USD  
- `OS`: Operating system (Android / iOS)  
- `Rating`: User rating (1 to 5)  
- `Quantity_Sold`: Number of units sold  
- `Sales_Revenue`: Total revenue generated  
- `Profit`: Profit made per phone

## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. ✅ Total Sales Revenue  
2. ✅ Total Profit  
3. ✅ Number of units sold per Brand  
4. ✅ Average price per Brand  
5. ✅ Top-rated phone  
6. ✅ Average rating per OS  
7. ✅ Most profitable phones  
8. ✅ Average profit per unit sold  
9. ✅ Comparison of Android vs iOS in terms of revenue, profit, and sales

## 📈 Analytical Questions Answered

- **Which brand sold the most phones?**  
- **Which brand made the most profit?**  
- **Is there a relationship between RAM and sales?**  
- **Does battery size affect sales?**  
- **Which OS has the higher average rating – Android or iOS?**  
- **Do higher-priced phones sell more?**

Each question is answered using code, visualization, and statistical insights.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values (`Price`, `Sales_Revenue`, `Profit`)  
- Imputed missing `Profit` as 35% of revenue when needed  
- Removed outliers for more accurate analysis  
- Ensured data types are correct for analysis  

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Bar Charts** for brand-wise sales and profit  
- **Scatter Plots** to explore relationships (RAM vs Sales, Price vs Sales)  
- **Pie Charts** for OS distribution and ratings  
- **Heatmaps** for correlation between variables

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis revealed key insights about the smartphone market, such as:

- Certain brands dominate in terms of sales and profitability  
- Android and iOS differ significantly in ratings and sales behavior  
- Technical specifications like **RAM and Battery Size** have noticeable effects on performance in the market  
- There is a **weak-to-moderate** correlation between price and quantity sold – indicating price alone does not guarantee high sales

This project showcases the power of **data analysis** in making **informed business decisions** and highlights the **importance of data visualization** in communicating insights effectively.
